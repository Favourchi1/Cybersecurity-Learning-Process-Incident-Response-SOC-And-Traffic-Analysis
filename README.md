#  Cybersecurity Learning Update: Incident Response, SOC & Traffic Analysis

## Overview
This session provided a deep dive into the fundamentals of **Incident Response**, **Security Operations Centers (SOC)**, and **Network Traffic Analysis** — essential pillars for any aspiring cybersecurity professional.

## The 5 W’s of Incident Response
A structured approach to investigating incidents by addressing:
- **Who** triggered the incident  
- **What** happened  
- **When** it occurred  
- **Where** it took place  
- **Why** it happened  

These questions form the foundation of a thorough security investigation.

## CSIRT & SOC
- **CSIRT** (Computer Security Incident Response Team): A dedicated group responsible for managing and resolving incidents efficiently.
- **SOC** (Security Operations Center): The command center where analysts monitor, detect, and respond to security threats across systems, devices, and networks.

## Tools Covered
Hands-on experience with essential tools:
- **IDS/IPS** – Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems  
- **EDR** – Endpoint Detection and Response  
- **SIEM** – Security Information and Event Management tools  
- **Wireshark** and **Tcpdump** – For capturing and analyzing network traffic

## Incident Response Lifecycle
Explored the final four stages of the incident response process:
1. **Detection & Analysis**  
2. **Containment**  
3. **Eradication & Recovery**  
4. **Post-Incident Activity**

 Logged activities and findings in an **Incident Response Journal**.
